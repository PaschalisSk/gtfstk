GTFS Toolkit
============
This is a Python 3.4 tool kit for processing `General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTFS>`_ data in memory without a database.
It's mostly for computing network-level statistics, such as mean daily service distance per route and mean daily number of vehicles per stop.
Uses Pandas and Shapely to do the heavy lifting.
